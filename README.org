* Inetstream
C++11 Stream interface for easy networking
** What this is
A simple header only networking API for sending / receiving simple TCP / UDP
messages from Linux to Linux
** What this is not (yet)
An elaborate cross plattform messaging toolkit to send abstracted but typesafe
internet messages supporting TCP as well as UDP from one network peer to the
next, and it's all header only
** Examples
For examples please refer to the [[./test/test_tcp.cpp][TCP tests]] and [[./test/test_udp.cpp][UDP tests]] respectively. 
** TODO Things left to be done
[ ] allow UDP "servers" to send messages to UDP "clients" and UDP "clients" to
recv said messages
[ ] check for leaks using valgrind
[ ] wider OS support
