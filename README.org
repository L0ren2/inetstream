* Inetstream
C++ Stream interface for easy networking
** What this is
A simple header only networking API to send and receive simple messages from
Linux to Linux
** What this is not (yet)
An elaborate cross plattform messaging toolkit to send abstracted but typesafe
internet messages supporting TCP as well as UDP from one network peer to the
next, and it's all header only
** Examples
For examples please refer to the [[./test/test_tcp.cpp][TCP tests]] and [[./test/test_udp.cpp][UDP tests]] respectively. 
** TODO Things left to be done
[ ] non-blocking calls utilizing std::optional<inetstream<TCP>> for
server<TCP>::accept and client<TCP>::connect
- this will probably require the use of poll or select
- may be sufficient to set socket to O_NONBLOCK but may also not be
[ ] proper UDP support and tests
[ ] revisit TODO comments about sufficientness and freeaddrinfo
[ ] support for other platforms
